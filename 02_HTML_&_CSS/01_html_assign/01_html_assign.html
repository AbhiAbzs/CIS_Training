            <h3>A species of large cat in the subfamily Pantherinae</h3>
            <p>The <strong>lion</strong> (<em>Panthera leo</em>) is a <a href="#">species</a>
                in the family <a href="#">Felidae</a>; it is a muscular,
                deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy
                tuft at the end of its tail. The lion is <a href="#">sexually
                    dimorphic</a>; males are larger than females with a
                typical weight range of 150 to 250&nbsp;kg (330 to 550&nbsp;lb) for males and 120 to
                182&nbsp;kg (265 to 400&nbsp;lb) for females. Male lions have a prominent mane, which is
                the most recognisable feature of the species. A lion pride consists of a few adult males,
                related females and cubs. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on
                large <a href="#">ungulates</a>. The species is an <a href="#">apex</a> and <a href="#">keystone
                    predator</a>, although they scavenge when
                opportunities occur. Some lions have been known to hunt humans, although the species
                typically does not.
            </p>
            <p>Typically, the lion inhabits <a href="#">grasslands</a> and
                <a href="#">savannas</a> but is absent in dense <a href="#">forests</a>.
                It is usually more <a href="#">diurnal</a>
                than other big cats, but when persecuted it adapts to being active <a href="#">at
                    night</a> and <a href="#">at twilight</a>. In
                the <a href="#">Pleistocene</a>,
                the lion ranged throughout Eurasia, Africa and North America but today it has been reduced
                to fragmented populations in <a href="#">Sub-Saharan
                    Africa</a> and one critically endangered population in western India. It has been
                listed as <a href="#">Vulnerable</a> on
                the <a href="#">IUCN Red List</a> since 1996
                because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s.
                Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of
                the decline is not fully understood, <a href="#">habitat
                    loss</a> and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The lion's name, which is similar in many <a href="#">Romance languages</a>, is derived from <a href="#">Latin:</a>
                <sup>[4]</sup> and <a href="#"> Ancient
                    Greek:</a> λέων (leon). <sup>[5]</sup>The word lavi (<a href="#">Hebrew</a>: לָבִיא‎) may also be
                retated. <sup>[6]</sup>
